When I transitioned from an engineering researcher to a classical hatha yoga teacher, I needed a more logical way to explain the significance of Yoga. 

As per Patanjali, the author of Yoga Sutras, Yoga is a state of a human being without mental activities or thoughts. But why is such a state important? For one to desire to achieve such a state, one has to either get a positive experience of the state or know the limitations of the current state.

Over a period of time, from a personal observation of the mind, I came up with a simple and concise model. Surprisingly, that model was sufficient to explain a myriad of characteristics of the mind.

In this work, the memory is modeled as associative and is placed in a feedback loop with an attention network. Several functional aspects of the mind, such as perception, logical thoughts, intuition, dreams, mind wandering, desire, emotion, and empathy, are explained using this simple structure.

Working with this model has brought a lot of clarity for me. With this model, I can explain why some people may struggle with Yogic sadhana and the significance of focus. 

While the basic model is more or less final and the paper is almost complete, it is still a work in progress. Feel free to have a look. Let me know if you have any comments.
